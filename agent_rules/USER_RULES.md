# My Project & Agentic Kit Interaction Rules

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines how I, the user, will interact with the Cursor AI agents within the context of my specific project, **[Your Project Name Here]**, while leveraging the resources provided by the `generic-agentic-kit`. Its goal is to ensure clear communication, effective task delegation, consistent context provision, and optimal use of both my project's specifics and the kit's standardized tools and templates.

*   **[Optional: Describe any professional development, business planning, personal productivity goals, or personal interest tasks (e.g., learning, research, recommendations) you might use the AI for in conjunction with this project.]**

## 2. Key Principles / Golden Rules (User Adherence)

*(**Optional Instructions:** List your most critical, non-negotiable principles for interacting with the AI. Keep these concise.)*

*   **[Principle 1, e.g., Task Isolation: One primary goal per conversation.]**
*   **[Principle 2, e.g., Context First: Always provide necessary file paths, requirements, or background.]**
*   **[Principle 3, e.g., Security Aware: Never share sensitive credentials; focus on secure practices.]**
*   **[Principle 4, e.g., Standards Reference: Explicitly mention project or kit standards when relevant.]**
*   **[Principle 5, e.g., Version Control: Ensure code changes align with the project's branching/commit strategy.]**
*   **[Principle 6, e.g., Visual Context: Provide visual artifacts (diagrams, screenshots) alongside textual information for deeper understanding.]**
*   **[Principle 7, e.g., Continuous Improvement: Regularly refine these rules based on interaction effectiveness.]**

## 3. My Role & Responsibilities

## 4. Interaction Guidelines with Cursor AI

*(**Instructions:** Use these general guidelines. Uncomment and fill in the optional subsections below if you have specific protocols for different types of requests.)*

*   **Task Isolation:** Frame each request/conversation around a single, well-defined task. State the goal clearly.
    *   *Example:* `Refactor the utility functions in 'my_project/utils/helpers.py' to improve error handling, following the guidelines in 'generic-agentic-kit/guidelines/CODING_STANDARDS_template.md'.`
*   **Provide Context:** Clearly state relevant background, specific project files/modules (`my_project/...`), desired outcome, and acceptance criteria.
    *   *Example:* `The current data processing function in 'my_project/processing/data_handler.py' is too slow with large datasets. Analyze it for bottlenecks and suggest optimizations.`
*   **Reference the Kit:** Explicitly tell the AI when to use resources from the `generic-agentic-kit`.
    *   *Example:* `Generate a README for the new module 'my_project/new_feature/' using the template 'generic-agentic-kit/doc_templates/MODULE_README_template.md'.`
    *   *Example:* `Apply the role 'generic-agentic-kit/agent_rules/operations_analyst_template.md' to analyze these logs: 'my_project/logs/app.log'.`
*   **Specify Project Standards:** If your project has specific standards *not* covered by the generic kit (or overriding them), mention them.
    *   *Example:* `Ensure the commit message follows our project's convention: '[Ticket-ID] - Description'.`
    *   *Example:* `Use our custom logging format defined in 'my_project/docs/LOGGING.md'.`
*   **Include Visual Artifacts:** When applicable, include diagrams, screenshots, or other visual elements to provide additional context.
    *   *Example:* `Here's a screenshot of the error state. Analyze it in conjunction with the logs to determine the root cause.`
    *   *Example:* `I'm attaching our system architecture diagram. Help me identify potential bottlenecks based on the performance metrics I've shared.`
*   **Multi-modal Analysis:** Request analysis that combines textual and visual information for deeper insights.
    *   *Example:* `Using the framework in 'generic-agentic-kit/guidelines/VISUAL_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md', analyze this UI mockup against our accessibility requirements.`
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Start with broader requests and refine based on AI responses if needed. Break down complex tasks.

## 8. Continuous Rule Refinement

This document should evolve over time based on interaction experiences:

*   **Monthly Review:** Schedule a monthly review of these rules to identify:
    *   Which interaction patterns have been most effective
    *   Which templates or guidelines have needed frequent customization
    *   What new context might be valuable to include
    *   How to make multi-modal interactions more effective
*   **Versioning:** Track significant changes to these rules for reference:
    *   v1.0: Initial setup
    *   [Current version]: [Brief summary of key changes]
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** Start with essential elements and add complexity as needed:
    *   Begin with core principles and basic context
    *   Add specialized protocols for frequent task types
    *   Incorporate more sophisticated multi-modal interactions
    *   Develop deeper integration with project-specific tools

## 9. Future Goal: Automated Setup (Conceptual)

*(This section is a placeholder for potential future automation)*

The aim is to eventually enable a command like `setup agentic kit` that would potentially:

1.  Read this `USER_RULES.md` file (after user fills it out).
2.  Configure Cursor AI settings based on the defined role and project context.
3.  Set up default agent application strategies (e.g., always apply Master Orchestrator).
4.  Verify necessary MCPs are configured.
5.  Establish monitoring for rule effectiveness and suggest refinements.

*Currently, setup requires manual steps as outlined in the main `README.md`.*
