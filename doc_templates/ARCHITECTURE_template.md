# Architecture Overview: [Project Name]

## 1. Introduction

*   **Purpose:** Briefly describe the system's primary function and goals.
*   **Scope:** Define what is included and excluded from this system.
*   **Audience:** Identify the intended readers (e.g., developers, architects, operations).

## 2. Goals & Constraints

*   **Architectural Goals:** List key quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, security, performance, reliability).
*   **Technical Constraints:** List any limitations (e.g., specific technology stack, budget, existing infrastructure, compliance requirements).
*   **Business Constraints:** List relevant business limitations (e.g., time-to-market, target user base).

## 3. High-Level Architecture

*   **System Context Diagram:** (Optional: Use Mermaid or describe) Show how the system interacts with external users and systems.
*   **Container/Component Diagram:** (Optional: Use Mermaid or describe) Show the major logical components/services and their responsibilities.
*   **Technology Choices:** List the primary technologies, frameworks, and platforms used and justify key choices.

```
*(Example Mermaid Diagram)*

## 4. Key Architectural Decisions

*   Document significant design choices made and the rationale behind them.
*   Include trade-offs considered.
    *   *Decision:* [e.g., Choice of Database]
    *   *Rationale:* [e.g., Scalability needs, team familiarity]
    *   *Alternatives Considered:* [e.g., Alternative DB options]
    *   *Trade-offs:* [e.g., Higher cost, learning curve]

## 5. Data Management

*   **Data Model Overview:** Describe the main data entities and their relationships (can include a Mermaid ERD).
*   **Persistence Strategy:** Explain how data is stored (e.g., relational database, NoSQL, file system).
*   **Data Migration:** Outline any data migration considerations.

## 6. Deployment View

*   **Infrastructure Overview:** Describe the target infrastructure (e.g., Cloud provider, On-premise, Kubernetes).
*   **Deployment Strategy:** Explain how the system is deployed (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, manual steps).
*   **Environments:** Describe the different deployment environments (e.g., Dev, Staging, Production).

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

*   **Security:** Outline the approach to authentication, authorization, data protection, etc.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Describe how the system will be monitored and what logging practices are in place.
*   **Scalability & Performance:** Detail strategies for handling load and achieving performance goals.
*   **Reliability & Availability:** Explain approaches to fault tolerance and uptime.

## 8. Glossary

*   Define key terms and acronyms used in the document.
