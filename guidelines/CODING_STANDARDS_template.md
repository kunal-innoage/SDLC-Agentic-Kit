# [Project Name] Coding Standards

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices to be followed for the [Project Name] project. Adhering to these standards ensures code consistency, readability, maintainability, and reduces the likelihood of errors.

These guidelines are intended to supplement, not replace, the official style guides for the primary languages and frameworks used in this project (e.g., [Link to Python PEP 8], [Link to JavaScript Standard Style], [Link to Framework Style Guide]).

## General Principles

*   **Readability:** Write code that is easy for other developers (and your future self) to understand. Prioritize clarity over excessive cleverness.
*   **Simplicity (KISS):** Keep It Simple, Stupid. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
*   **Consistency:** Follow the established patterns and styles used throughout the codebase.
*   **Maintainability:** Write code that is easy to modify, debug, and extend.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code. Use functions, classes, or other abstractions to promote reuse.
*   **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Avoid implementing functionality that is not currently required.

## Language-Specific Standards

### [Primary Language, e.g., Python]

*   **Style Guide:** Strictly follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Use linters (e.g., Flake8, Pylint) configured to enforce this.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Modules: `lower_case_with_underscores`
    *   Classes: `CapWords` (PascalCase)
    *   Functions/Methods: `lower_case_with_underscores`
    *   Variables: `lower_case_with_underscores`
    *   Constants: `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
*   **Docstrings:** Use [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) conventions for all public modules, classes, functions, and methods. Use a standard format (e.g., Google style, NumPy style).
*   **Imports:** Follow PEP 8 import guidelines (standard library first, then third-party, then local, separated by blank lines).
*   **Error Handling:** Use specific exception types. Avoid broad `except Exception: pass` blocks.
*   **[Framework Specifics, e.g., Django/Flask]:**
    *   [e.g., Follow Django coding style guide]
    *   [e.g., Use Flask blueprints for organization]

### [Secondary Language, e.g., JavaScript]

*   **Style Guide:** Follow [e.g., StandardJS, Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide]. Use linters (e.g., ESLint) configured appropriately.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Variables/Functions: `camelCase`
    *   Classes: `PascalCase`
    *   Constants: `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`
*   **Framework Specifics (e.g., React, Vue, Node.js):**
    *   [e.g., Component naming conventions]
    *   [e.g., Use functional components with hooks where possible]
    *   [e.g., Asynchronous code patterns (async/await)]

## Formatting & Readability

*   **Indentation:** Use [e.g., 4 spaces] for indentation (no tabs).
*   **Line Length:** Keep lines under [e.g., 80 or 100] characters where practical.
*   **Whitespace:** Use whitespace effectively to improve readability (e.g., around operators, after commas, blank lines between logical blocks).
*   **Comments:** Write comments to explain *why* code does something, not *what* it does (the code should explain the what). Keep comments concise and up-to-date.

## Code Structure & Organization

*   **Modularity:** Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions or classes with clear responsibilities.
*   **File Structure:** Follow the project's established directory structure.
*   **Configuration:** Avoid hardcoding configuration values. Use environment variables or configuration files.

## Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for core logic, complex functions, and edge cases.
*   **Integration Tests:** Write tests to verify interactions between components or services.
*   **Test Naming:** Use descriptive names for test functions/methods (e.g., `test_user_login_with_invalid_password`).
*   **Coverage:** Aim for reasonable test coverage, focusing on critical paths and complex logic.

## Version Control (Git)

*   **Branching:** Follow the project's branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow). Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-user-profile`, `fix/login-bug`).
*   **Commits:**
    *   Make small, atomic commits with a single logical change.
    *   Write clear, concise commit messages following [e.g., Conventional Commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Include relevant issue tracker IDs (e.g., `feat: Add user profile page (JIRA-123)`).
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):**
    *   Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized.
    *   Write clear PR descriptions explaining the changes and linking to relevant issues.
    *   Ensure tests pass and code meets standards before requesting review.

## Security

*   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all external input (user input, API requests).
*   **Secrets Management:** Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords) directly into the codebase. Use secure methods like environment variables or secrets management tools.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies up-to-date and be aware of known vulnerabilities.
*   **(If applicable) SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries or ORMs correctly. Avoid string formatting for SQL.
*   **(If applicable) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Properly encode or sanitize output displayed in web contexts.

## Review Process

*   All code changes should be reviewed via Pull Requests before merging.
*   Reviewers should focus on adherence to standards, correctness, maintainability, security, and performance.
*   Provide constructive feedback.
*   Authors should address review comments promptly.

## Code Organization

### File Size and Structure
- Keep files under 300-500 lines
- Split by functionality when files grow too large
- Organize related functionality in the same directory
- Use a consistent file structure within each module

### Component Isolation
- Design components with clear interfaces
- Minimize dependencies between components
- Use dependency injection to reduce coupling
- Create abstractions for external services

### Configuration Management
- Externalize configuration from code
- Use environment variables for deployment-specific settings
- Include sensible defaults for development
- Document all configuration options

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Principles
- Profile before optimizing

- Validate all input at the entry point
- Use strong typing where available
- Implement whitelisting rather than blacklisting
- Sanitize output to prevent injection attacks

### Authentication and Authorization
- Implement proper authentication for all protected resources
- Use role-based or attribute-based access control
- Verify authorization for all sensitive operations
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
