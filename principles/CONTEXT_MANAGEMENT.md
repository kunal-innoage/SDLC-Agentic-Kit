## Introduction

Effective context management is essential for agentic development workflows. Context encompasses the relevant information, history, and state needed for agents to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. This document outlines principles and approaches for managing context in agentic development environments.

## Core Principles

### 1. Context Hierarchy

Context should be organized in a hierarchical structure from broad to specific:

1. **Global Context**
   - Project-wide information
   - Organizational standards
   - Technology stack details
   - Business domain knowledge

2. **Component Context**
   - Subsystem architectures
   - Component responsibilities
   - Integration points
   - Domain-specific requirements

3. **Task-Specific Context**
   - Current task objectives
   - Related changes
   - Historical decisions
   - User preferences

### 2. Context Relevance

Not all context is equally important for every agent operation:

1. **Primary Context**
   - Essential information without which the agent cannot function effectively
   - Must be provided in every interaction
   - Example: Task ID, target component, user intent

2. **Secondary Context**
   - Information that enhances agent effectiveness but isn't critical
   - Can be retrieved on demand
   - Example: Previous similar tasks, performance metrics, related documentation

3. **Background Context**
   - Information that provides broader understanding
   - Enhances quality of agent output but not necessary for basic operation
   - Example: Business strategy, user personas, long-term roadmap

### 3. Context Freshness

Context has different lifespans and update requirements:

1. **Static Context**
   - Changes infrequently
   - Examples: Architecture diagrams, coding standards, business domain definitions

2. **Semi-Static Context**
   - Changes periodically but not continuously
   - Examples: Project roadmap, team structure, major dependencies

3. **Dynamic Context**
   - Changes frequently during development
   - Examples: Code state, current task status, recent user interactions

4. **Real-time Context**
   - Represents the current state and requires immediate updates
   - Examples: User presence, system status, active edits

### 4. Context Accessibility

Context should be accessible through standardized mechanisms:

1. **Explicit Access**
   - Direct retrieval of specific context elements
   - Clear and consistent API for context access
   - Example: `getTaskDetails(TASK-123)`, `getCodeQualityRules()`

2. **Implicit Access**
   - Context derivation from environment
   - Automatic context gathering based on agent role
   - Example: File path context from current IDE focus

3. **Progressive Access**
   - Initial minimal context with on-demand expansion
   - Prioritized loading of most relevant context first
   - Example: Loading high-level task details first, then retrieving specific requirements as needed

## Document Reference System

### 1. Standardized Path Structure

Organize project documents in a consistent, predictable structure:

```
project-root/
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture/
│   │   ├── OVERVIEW.md
│   │   ├── COMPONENT_A.md
│   │   └── COMPONENT_B.md
│   ├── specifications/
│   │   ├── FEATURE_X.md
│   │   └── FEATURE_Y.md
│   ├── guidelines/
│   │   ├── CODING_STANDARDS.md
│   │   └── TESTING_STRATEGY.md
│   └── operations/
│       ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
│       └── MONITORING.md
├── src/
│   └── [source code]
└── TASK.md
```

### 2. Context Referencing Convention

Use a standardized format for referencing documents and context:

1. **Direct Document References**
   - Format: `@document:{path/to/document.md}`
   - Example: `@document:docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md`

2. **Section References**
   - Format: `@document:{path/to/document.md}#section-id`
   - Example: `@document:docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md#data-flow`

3. **Code References**
   - Format: `@code:{path/to/file.ext}:line-start:line-end`
   - Example: `@code:src/api/users.js:45:78`

4. **Task References**
   - Format: `@task:{TASK-ID}`
   - Example: `@task:FEAT-123`

### 3. Metadata Tagging System

Enhance documents with metadata to improve context retrieval:

```markdown
<!-- Context Metadata
{
  "document_type": "architecture_overview",
  "version": "2.1",
  "last_updated": "2025-01-15",
  "related_documents": [
    "docs/architecture/COMPONENT_A.md",
    "docs/architecture/COMPONENT_B.md"
  ],
  "domain_areas": ["user_management", "authentication"],
  "stakeholders": ["engineering", "security"],
  "priority_level": "high"
}

## Knowledge Graph Construction

### 1. Entity Relationship Model

Construct a knowledge graph that maps relationships between context entities:

1. **Entity Types**
   - Documents (architecture diagrams, specifications)
   - Code Components (modules, classes, functions)
   - Tasks (features, bugs, technical debt)
   - Concepts (domain terms, technical concepts)
   - Actors (users, teams, stakeholders)

2. **Relationship Types**
   - Dependencies ("depends on", "requires")
   - Composition ("contains", "part of")
   - Sequence ("follows", "precedes")
   - Association ("related to", "similar to")
   - Interaction ("used by", "impacts")

3. **Entity Attributes**
   - Importance (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Confidence (verified, likely, uncertain)
   - Freshness (current, recent, outdated)
   - Origin (user-provided, system-derived, agent-generated)

### 2. Context Relevance Scoring

Implement a scoring system to prioritize context based on relevance:

1. **Relevance Factors**
   - Recency: How recently the context was referenced or updated
   - Frequency: How often the context is referenced in related tasks
   - Proximity: How closely related the context is to the current task
   - Specificity: How precisely the context matches the current need
   - User Emphasis: How strongly the user has highlighted this context

2. **Scoring Algorithm**
   ```
   relevance_score = 
     (recency_weight * recency_score) +
     (frequency_weight * frequency_score) +
     (proximity_weight * proximity_score) +
     (specificity_weight * specificity_score) +
     (user_emphasis_weight * user_emphasis_score)
   ```

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**
   - Adjust weights based on agent role (Documentation Manager values documentation context more highly)
   - Adapt to user behavior (increase weights for context types the user frequently references)
   - Evolve over time based on feedback (successful vs. unsuccessful agent interactions)

### 3. Information Decay Handling

Account for the natural decay of information relevance over time:

1. **Decay Function**
   ```
   current_relevance = base_relevance * e^(-decay_rate * time_elapsed)
   ```

2. **Differential Decay Rates**
   - Architecture documentation: slow decay
   - Code context: medium decay
   - Task status: rapid decay

3. **Renewal Mechanism**
   - Reset decay when context is explicitly referenced
   - Partial reset when related context is referenced
   - Periodic validation of critical context

## Context Resolution Strategy

### 1. Conflict Resolution

Handle conflicting context information systematically:

1. **Resolution Hierarchy**
   - User-provided context overrides all other sources
   - Recently updated documentation overrides older documentation
   - Specific context overrides general context
   - Code context overrides documentation when they conflict

2. **Uncertainty Handling**
   - Explicitly identify conflicting information
   - Present multiple possibilities with confidence levels
   - Request clarification for critical conflicts

3. **Conflict Documentation**
   - Record detected conflicts
   - Track resolution decisions
   - Update documentation to address persistent conflicts

### 2. Missing Context Management

Develop strategies for operating with incomplete context:

1. **Identification**
   - Explicitly identify missing critical context
   - Assess impact on agent capabilities

2. **Acquisition Strategies**
   - Direct questions to users
   - Inference from available context
   - Retrieval from external sources

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Provide best-effort results with clear limitations
   - Offer multiple alternatives based on different assumptions
   - Defer complex decisions requiring missing context

### 3. Context Verification

Implement mechanisms to verify context accuracy:

1. **Consistency Checking**
   - Cross-reference related context sources
   - Identify logical inconsistencies
   - Flag temporally impossible combinations

2. **User Confirmation**
   - Verify critical assumptions with users
   - Present key context being used for important decisions
   - Allow correction of misunderstood context

3. **Continuous Validation**
   - Update context based on observed results
   - Record validation history
   - Adjust confidence levels based on verification outcomes

## Project-Specific Glossary

### 1. Terminology Management

Maintain a project-specific glossary to ensure consistent understanding:

1. **Term Definition Structure**
   ```
   {
     "term": "Authentication",
     "definition": "The process of verifying the identity of a user or system",
     "context": "security",
     "related_terms": ["Authorization", "Identity", "Credentials"],
     "synonyms": ["Auth", "Identity Verification"],
     "examples": ["Username/password authentication", "OAuth flow"]
   }
   ```

2. **Glossary Integration**
   - Reference glossary in documentation
   - Highlight defined terms in user interactions
   - Expand abbreviations and technical terms automatically

3. **Term Resolution**
   - Handle polysemy (same term, different meanings in different contexts)
   - Manage terminology evolution over time
   - Track deprecated terms and their replacements

### 2. Domain-Specific Language

Document and interpret domain-specific language patterns:

1. **Language Patterns**
   - Industry-specific terminology
   - Company-specific abbreviations
   - Technical jargon particular to the stack

2. **Translation Mechanisms**
   - Convert between technical and non-technical language
   - Adapt terminology based on user role
   - Provide expanding levels of detail based on context

3. **Consistency Enforcement**
   - Flag inconsistent terminology usage
   - Suggest standard terminology
   - Update documentation to align with preferred terms

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Context Storage

Implement efficient context storage mechanisms:

1. **File-Based Context**
   - Markdown files with structured metadata
   - YAML/JSON configuration files
   - Embedded documentation in code

2. **Database Context**
   - Graph database for complex relationships
   - Document database for unstructured context
   - Relational database for structured context

3. **In-Memory Context**
   - Working memory for active context
   - Cache for frequently accessed context
   - Volatile context for temporary state

### 2. Context Retrieval Optimization

Optimize context retrieval for agent efficiency:

1. **Indexing Strategies**
   - Full-text search index
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Metadata index for attribute-based filtering

2. **Caching Mechanisms**
   - Preload frequently used context
   - Cache context based on user and task patterns
   - Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction

3. **Progressive Loading**
   - Retrieve essential context first
   - Load additional context on demand
   - Background loading of likely-needed context

### 3. Context Synchronization

Ensure context remains synchronized across agents and users:

1. **Change Detection**
   - File system watchers
   - Database triggers
   - Event-based notifications

2. **Update Propagation**
   - Publish-subscribe system for context updates
   - Atomic updates for critical context
   - Batch updates for non-critical changes

3. **Consistency Guarantees**
   - Strong consistency for critical context
   - Eventual consistency for non-critical context
   - Versioned context to prevent lost updates

## Best Practices

1. **Minimize Context Switching**
   - Group related tasks to maintain consistent context
   - Preserve context between interactions
   - Provide context summaries when switching is necessary

2. **Explicit Context Setting**
   - Allow users to explicitly set critical context
   - Confirm understanding of context changes
   - Provide visibility into active context

3. **Context Visualization**
   - Display relevant context graphically
   - Highlight active context elements
   - Show relationships between context elements

4. **Continuous Refinement**
   - Learn from successful and unsuccessful interactions
   - Adjust context relevance based on outcomes
   - Regularly prune outdated or unused context

5. **User-Centered Context**
   - Adapt to individual user working patterns
   - Remember user preferences for context presentation
   - Allow customization of context importance
