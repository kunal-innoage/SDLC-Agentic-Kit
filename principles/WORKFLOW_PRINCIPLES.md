# Workflow Principles

## Introduction

This document outlines the core principles governing effective workflows when working with AI agents. These principles help establish consistent, efficient, and productive interaction patterns that leverage the strengths of both human expertise and AI capabilities within the software development lifecycle.

## Core Workflow Principles

### 1. Task Isolation

**Core Principle:** Focus each interaction on a single, well-defined task with clear boundaries and acceptance criteria.

**Rationale:**
- Enables more precise context management
- Simplifies evaluation of task completion
- Reduces cognitive load for both humans and AI
- Facilitates accurate tracking of progress

**Implementation:**
- Define a clear objective for each conversation or task
- Avoid scope creep by postponing tangential issues to separate tasks
- Create distinct conversations for different aspects of a larger problem
- Establish clear acceptance criteria before starting

### 2. Context-Driven Interaction

**Core Principle:** Provide relevant context upfront and build shared understanding incrementally.

**Rationale:**
- Reduces back-and-forth clarifications
- Improves accuracy of AI responses
- Creates persistent knowledge base for future interactions
- Enables deeper, more specialized assistance

**Implementation:**
- Start with essential context (project details, specific files, goals)
- Reference relevant documentation, guidelines, or previous discussions
- Include necessary technical constraints or requirements
- Build context progressively through conversation

### 3. Structured Communication

**Core Principle:** Use consistent formats and patterns for different types of requests and responses.

**Rationale:**
- Creates predictable interaction patterns
- Reduces ambiguity in requests
- Simplifies parsing and processing of information
- Builds shared communication conventions

**Implementation:**
- Use standardized command patterns for specific request types
- Follow established templates for common documentation tasks
- Adopt consistent formatting for code reviews and feedback
- Maintain clear separation between discussion and action items

### 4. Iterative Refinement

**Core Principle:** Start with broad direction and refine through progressive iterations rather than attempting perfect specification upfront.

**Rationale:**
- Leverages AI's ability to generate initial drafts quickly
- Provides concrete material for feedback
- Enables rapid exploration of solution space
- Accommodates evolving understanding of requirements

**Implementation:**
- Begin with a clear but general objective
- Provide feedback on initial output to guide refinement
- Identify specific aspects to improve in each iteration
- Establish exit criteria to determine when refinement is complete

### 5. Role Specialization

**Core Principle:** Assign specialized roles to AI agents based on the specific task requirements and domain expertise needed.

**Rationale:**
- Enables deeper specialization for complex tasks
- Creates consistent mental models for task types
- Allows targeted context provision
- Simplifies workflow selection

**Implementation:**
- Select appropriate agent role based on primary task objective
- Reference role definitions from the agent_rules directory
- Provide role-specific context and constraints
- Maintain consistent role assignment across related tasks

### 6. Multi-Modal Integration

**Core Principle:** Combine textual, visual, and data-driven information sources for deeper insights and more comprehensive problem-solving.

**Rationale:**
- Addresses different aspects of complex problems
- Leverages complementary information sources
- Enhances understanding through multiple perspectives
- Provides richer context for decision-making

**Implementation:**
- Incorporate relevant visual artifacts alongside textual descriptions
- Associate log data with visual representations of system state
- Connect architecture diagrams with performance metrics
- Link user interface mockups with user stories and requirements

## Multi-Modal Workflow Patterns

### Text + Visual Workflows
